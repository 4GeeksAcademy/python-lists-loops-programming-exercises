# `14` Matrix Builder

After some malicious code, mainly by Mr. Smith, the matrix has some gaping
hole and it needs some help to rebuild. Create a matrix of random 0's, and 1's based on a parameter.

#📝Instructions
1. Create a function called matrixBuilder, which will expect 1 parameter (an integer).
    This number represents the amount of rows and columns for the matrix.
    Example: 5 means that the matrix should be 5x5.
2. This function should return a list of lists that represents the matrix. Example: 3 should return:

[
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]
]

💡Hint:
Remember that the 1's and 0's are random.
