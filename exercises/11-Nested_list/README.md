# `11` Nested list

It is possible to find a list comprised of other lists, it is called a two-dimension list or `matrix`.

In this example, we have a list of coordinates that you can access by doing the following:

```py
longitude = []

for loop in coordinate longitude

longitude = coordinatesList[0][1];
```

# 📝Instructions:
Loop through the list printing only the longitudes.
```py
The result should be something like this:
-112.633853
-63.987
-81.901693
-71.653268
```

💡Hint:
- Remember the index of the position 1 is `list[0]`
