#  The magic pass below: 
# ✅ ↓ Create a variable, like "i", that uses the last index position in the array "my_sample_list". Remember we can access the length property of an array using len, and that the position will always be 1 less than the item number (item one is index 0, item 5653 would be one less...) ↓ ✅

i = len(my_sample_list) - 1 

# You can now use the variable holding the last position to iterate until you get to the first position- which will always be 0. Create a for loop using that variable, make sure the value of the variable is modified on each iteration of the loop.
# while some_variable_reference > 0:
#     print(my_sample_list[some_variable_reference])
#     chage after doing what we wanted, change the variables value so that the next pass it references the new index position
