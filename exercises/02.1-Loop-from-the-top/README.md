# `02.1` Loop from the top

This loop is `looping` the list from beginning to end... increasing one by one:

```py
my_list = [2, 56, 9]

for item in my_list:
    print(item) # 2 -> 56 -> 9
```

## 📝Instructions::

1. Lets try looping from the end to the beginning.

## Expected result:

```py
12
25
23
55
56432
48
23
867543
8
654
47889
4
5
3423
```

## 💡Hint:

+ Even though in this exercise we only use one approach, there are multiple ways of looping in reverse, check it out:
