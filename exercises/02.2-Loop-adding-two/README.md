# `02.2` Loop adding two


The given code is `looping` the whole array, `one by one`.


## 📝Instructions:

1. Change the loop so it loops `two by two` instead of one by one.

## Expected result:

```py
3423
4
654
867543
48
55
25
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ Do not think about it too much, you only need to do a very small change.
