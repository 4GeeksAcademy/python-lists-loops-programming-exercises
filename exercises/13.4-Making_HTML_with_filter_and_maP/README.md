# `13.4` Making HTML using filter function and map funtion

# 📝Instructions from your teacher:
1. Create generate_li and filter_colors function to make the exercise print the following HTML with only the sexy colors:

```py
Expected:
<li>Red</li><li>Orange</li><li>Pink</li><li>Violet</li>
```

💡Hint:
- Maybe you have to use filter() for colors first and map() function to
set values to the new variables.
