# `14.2` Letter counter

# 📝Instructions

Our customer needs a program that counts the letters repetitions in a given string, for example:

The string "Hello World" contains the following repetitions `h=1 e=1 l=3 o=2 w=1 r=1 d=1`

1. Count the letters in the string used in `par` and print the number of times it is repeated throughout the string.

2. Capitalization should not affect the count (ie if there is a string that contains a capital "A" as well as a lowercase "a" the count for a should be 2).

3. Spaces should be ignored!


## Expected result:

```py

print(count("Hello World"))

//will print on the console { "h":1 "e":1 "l":3 "o":2 "w":1 "r":1 "d":1 }
```
