# `14.2` Letter counter

## 📝Instructions:

Our customer needs a program that counts the letters repetitions in a given string, for example:

The string "Hello World" contains the following repetitions `h=1 e=1 l=3 o=2 w=1 r=1 d=1`

1. Count the letters in the string used in par and print the number of times it is repeated throughout the string.

2. Capitalization should not affect the count (ie if there is a string that contains a capital `A` as well as a lowercase `a` the count for a should be 2).

3. Spaces should be ignored!

## Expected outcome:

```py

print(count("Hello World"))

# will print on the console { "h":1 "e":1 "l":3 "o":2 "w":1 "r":1 "d":1 }
```
