# `09` Max integer from my_list

## 📝Instruccions:

1. Write a `script` that finds the biggest integer in list.

2. Print that number in the console with the `print()` function.


## 💡 Hint:


- Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to 0.

- then compare the variables with all the items in the list.

- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable.

- At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

## Expected result:

 ```py
Your result should be 5435.
```
