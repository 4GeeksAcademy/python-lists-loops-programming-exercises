# `09` Max integer from my_list


# 📝Instructions
1. Write a script that finds the biggest integer in list
2. Print that number in the console with the print() function.

💡Hint:
- Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to 0.
- then compare the variables with all the items in the list.
- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable.
- At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

 ```py
Your result should be 5435.
