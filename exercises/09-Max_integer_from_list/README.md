# `09` Max integer from my_list

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function named `maxInteger`

2. This function should take a list as an input parameter and 
return the maximum number found in the list. 

3. You should use a 'for' loop to iterate through the list. 

4. Use the `print()` function to print what the function returns when it is called.
  - For **example**: `print(myFunction(param))` 

## 💡 Hint:

- Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to `0`.

- Then compare the variables with all the items in the list.

- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable.

- At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

## Expected Result:

 ```py
Your result should be 5435.
```
