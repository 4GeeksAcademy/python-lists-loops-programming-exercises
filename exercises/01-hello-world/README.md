# `01` Hello World

In Python, we use `print` to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.)
in something called `the console`.

Every language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning
(before the Windows or MacOS arrived). 

Today, printing in the console is used mostly as a monitoring tool, ideal to leave a trace of the content of variables during the program execution.

This is an example of how to use it:

```py
print("How are you?")
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Use the `print()` function to print `Hello World` on the console. 

## üí° Hint:
