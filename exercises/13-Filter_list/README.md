# `13` Filter list

Another looping function that is available on python is the `filter()` function. Its main purpose is to remove elements from the original list and return a new list with the result.

The code on the left is filtering the odd numbers from the `allNumbers` list.

## 📝Instructions:

1. Please update the `filter()` function so it filters all the numbers bigger than 10.


## Expected result:

```py
Expected output:

[ 23, 12, 35, 54, 21, 534, 23, 42 ]
```
