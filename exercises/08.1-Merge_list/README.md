# `08.1` Merge List

## 📝 Instructions:

Write a function `merge_list` that merges two lists and returns a single new list merging all the values of both lists.

 1. Declare an empty list.

 2. Loop the two lists.

 3. Concatenate the results in an empty list.

 4. Print the new variable with the merged lists.

 ## 💡 Hints:

+ You will have to loop through each list and insert their items into a new list.

+ There are more ways to merge lists in python, this would be a good time for you to search on the Internet "how to merge lists in python".

['Lebron', 'Aaliyah', 'Diamond', 'Dominique', 'Aliyah', 'Jazmin', 'Darnell', 'Lucas', 'Jake', 'Scott', 'Amy', 'Molly', 'Hannah', 'Lucas']
```
