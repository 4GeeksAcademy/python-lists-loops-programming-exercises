# `01.3` Print the last one

You will never know how many items `my_stupid_list` has, because it is being randomly generated during runtime!

You know that the property:

```py
len(list_name)
```

returns the length of `list_name`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Import `random` at the beginning of the file.

2. Create a variable named `the_last_one`, and assign it the LAST element of `my_stupid_list`.

3. Print `the_last_one` to the console.

## 💡 Hints:

- To use the random functionality, we must import. The most effective way is by using `import random` at the beginning of the document.

+ For more information about importing, check out the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html?highlight=importing.

+ To access the first element in a list we use `my_list_name[0]`, the second with `my_list_name[1]` and so on. 

+ To access items starting at the *end* of the list, we can use negative values starting from `my_list_name[-1]` (there is no [-0]).
