# `01.3` Print the last one

You will never know how many items `my_stupid_list` has, because it is being randomly generated during runtime!

You know that the property:
```py
len(name_list) # function
```
returns the `length` of name_list .

## üìù Instructions:

1. Import `random function` at the beginning of the file.

2. Create a variable named `the_last_one`, and assign it the LAST element of `my_stupid_list`.

3. Print `the_last_one` to the console.

## üí° Hint:

- To use the random functionality, we must import. The most effective way is by using `import random`, without the quotes, at the beginning of the document.

+ For more information about importing, check out the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html?highlight=importing.

+ To access the first element in a list by using `my_list_name[0]`, the second with `my_list_name[1]` and so on. 

+ To access items starting at the *end* of the list, we can use negative values starting from `my_list_name[-1]` (there is no [-0]).
