# `05.1` Sum the odd numbers


## 📝Instructions:

1. Create a function called `sumOdds` that sums all the odd numbers in the `arr` variable.

2. Return and print the result.

Follow these steps:

+ Declare an auxiliar variable outside the loop to keep adding the values.

- Create a function.

- You have to loop the list.

- On each loop, you have to ask if the value of the list in that index position is an `odd` number.

- If its `odd` then add the value to the auxiliar variable.

## 💡 Hint:

+ An **auxiliar variable** is a regular variable, the only difference is a logical difference; anauxiliar variable is like a chosen one, **it'll be useful until it completes its purpose (add all the values, make a copy of a value, etc).**
