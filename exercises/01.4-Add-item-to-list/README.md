# `01.4` Add items to the list

## 📝Instructions:
1. Import the necessary module to generate random numbers. 
2. Add 5 random integers between 1 and 100 to the `my_list`.  

## 💡 Hints: 
- You have to use `import random` to import the random module.
- Use function `random.randint()` to generate a random integer between `1` and `100` (inclusive).
- To add an item to the end of a list, use the `append()` method. For example, to add the number `5` to a list named `example_list`, you'd use `example_list.append(5)`. 
- If you're unsure about how to use the `randint` function or any other Python function, searching online can be very helpful! This is just one of many good resources:

## Expected result:

Your list called `my_list` should have 10 items, with the last 5 being random numbers you added. For example:

```py
[4, 5, 734, 43, 45, 79, 96, 58, 46, 7] # Note: The last 5 numbers in your result might be different since they are randomly generated!
```
