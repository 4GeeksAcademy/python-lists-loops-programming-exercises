# `12.4` Map list of objects

The most common scenario for the mapping function is for simplifying given lists, for example:

The current algorithm creates a list with only the names of the people and prints it on the console.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. At this time the function is printing the names only. Please update the mapping function so it creates a list where each item contains the following:

`Hello, my name is Joe and I am 13 years old`

## 💡 Hint:

+ You have to get the age of each people based on their `birthDate`.

+ Search in Google "How to get the age of given birth date in python"

+ Inside your simplifier function you have to return a concatenation.

## Expected result:

The expected output should look similar but not exactly to this:

```py
[ 'Hello, my name is Joe and I am 32 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Bob and I am 42 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Erika and I am 28 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Dylan and I am 18 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Steve and I am 14 years old' ]
```
