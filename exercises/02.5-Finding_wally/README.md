# `02.5` Finding Wally

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Find Wally in the `poeple` list :D

2. Print the position(s) of Wally in the console.

## 💡 Hints:

- Use a loop and an if (conditional)
- Consider using the `enumarate` function to extract the position of Wally. Check out how `enumrate` is used in for loops: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/enumerate-in-python/#:~:text=Using%20Enumerate%20object,Python3

## 💎 Easter Egg:

What if there is more than one Wally?

## Expected result:

```py
65
198
```
