# `02.3` Loop from the half to the end


This loop is not looping at all... because the variables initialValue, stopValue and increasingValue are equal to zero.

# üìùInstructions:

1. Change the value of those variables to make the loop print only the last half of the list.

2. Change nothing but the value of those 3 variables!

## Expected result:

The result should be something like:

```py
23
48
56432
55
23
25
12
```
