# `02.3` Loop from the half to the end


This loop is not looping at all... because the variables initialValue, stopValue and increasingValue are equal to zero.

## 📝Instructions:

1. Change the value of those variables to make the loop print only the last half of the list.

2. Change nothing but the value of those 3 variables!

## Expected result:

```py
23
48
56432
55
23
25
12
```

## 💡 Hints: 

+ Remember that in `range(a, b)`, `b` is NOT included. For example, `range(0,3)` follows this sequence: `0 > 1 > 2`, the `3` is not included.
+ In `range(a,b)`, both `a` and `b` have to be integers, they cannot be floats, aka, decimal numbers.
