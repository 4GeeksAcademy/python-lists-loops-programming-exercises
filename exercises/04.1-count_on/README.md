# `04.1` Count On


As you saw in the last exercise your list can be a mix
`types of data` we are going to divide and conquer.

Would you be so kind to add all the items with data-type Dictionary and List into the hello list?

```py
💡Hint:
Here is how to print ALL the items.
my_list = [42, true, "towel", [2,1], 'hello', 34.4, {"name": "juan"}]

for x in my_list:
    print(x)
```

# 📝Instructions:

1. Loop the given list.

2. Push the data-types found to an new list called `hello`.

3. Print the variable `hello`.


# Expected result:

```py
[[2, 1], {'name': 'juan'}]
```
