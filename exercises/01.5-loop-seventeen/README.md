# `01.5` Loop from 1 to 17

To loop a specific number of times, we can use range(). In Python, range() returns a sequence of numbers starting with 0, incrementing by 1 each time until it reaches the range.

range() function example:

for x in range(5):
  print(x)
  
expected output:
0
1
2
3
4

Note that the number specified in range(), 5 in this example, is never reached and 4 is our last output. We can incorporate additional parameters to further specify (now could be a good time to google or at least check the HINT section ;) ).

# 📝Instructions from your teacher:
1. Count from 1 to 17 with a loop and print each number on the console.
