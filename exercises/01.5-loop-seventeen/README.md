# `01.5` Loop from 1 to 17

To loop a specific number of times, we can use 

```py
range(<start>,<end>)
```

In Python, `range(x,y)` returns a sequence of numbers starting with X, incrementing by 1 each time until it reaches the range. 

For example:

```python
for x in range(0,5):
  print(x)
```

Expected output:
```py
0
1
2
3
4
```

Note that the end number specified in `range()`, 5 in this example, is never reached and 4 is our last output. 

We can incorporate additional parameters to further specify (now could be a good time to google or at least check the HINT section ;) ).

## üìùInstructions:

1. Count from 1 to 17 with a loop and print each number on the console.  

## üí° Hint:

  - This is how you loop: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp

## Expected result:

```py
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
```
