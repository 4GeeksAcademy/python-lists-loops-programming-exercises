# `01.5` Loop from 1 to 17

To loop a specific number of times, we can use `range(<start>,<end>)`. 

In Python, `range(x,y)` returns a sequence of numbers starting with X, incrementing by 1 each time until it reaches the range. 

For example:

```python
for x in range(0,5):
  print(x)
```

Resultado esperado:

```md
0
1
2
3
4
```

> Note that the number `5` specified in `range()`, in this example, is never reached and `4` is our last output. 

We can incorporate additional parameters to further specify (now could be a good time to google or at least check the HINT section ;) ).

## 📝Instructions:

+ Count from `1` to `17` with a loop and **print** each number on the console.

## 💡 Hint:
