# `01.1` Access and retrieve

## 📝Instructions:

**Lists** are part of every programming language. They are the way to go when you want to have a 'list of elements'.

For example, we could have a list that is storing the days of the week:

```py
my_list = ['sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday']
```

> Note: These "lists" are also commonly referred to as `arrays` in other programming languages.

Every list has the following parts:

- `Items:` are the actual values inside on each position of the list.

- `Length:` is the size of the list, the number of items.

- `Index:` is the position of an element.

To access any particular item within the list you need to know its `index` (position).

The `index` is an integer value that represents the position in which the element is located.

### 🔎 Important:

Every list starts from zero (0)! So to get the `first item` we'd use `my_list[0]`

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Using the `print()` function, print the 3rd item from the list.

2. Change the value in the position where `Thursday'` is located to `None`.

3. Print the particular position of the step two.
