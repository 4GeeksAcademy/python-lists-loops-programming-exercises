# `09.1` Minimum integer:

It is possible to traverse a list using the `for` loop, you have to specify what to do on each iteration of the loop.


## 📝Instructions:

1.Create a function called `minInteger`

2.Inside the aforementioned function, please use the `for` loop function to get the minimum value of the list.

3.The `minInteger` function should then return the minimum value.

4.Lastly, you should print the returned value outside the function.
  + `print(minInteger(my_list))`

## 💡 Hint:

* Declare an Auxiliary Global Variable.

* Set it's value to a very big interger.

* Every time you loop, compare it's value to the item value. If the item value is smaller, update the auxiliary variable value to the item value.

* Outside of the loop, after the loop is finished, print the auxiliary value.

## Expected result:

```py
23
```
