# `09.1` Minimum integer:

It is possible to traverse an list using the list for loop,
you have to specify what to do on each iteration of the loop.


## 📝Instructions:

1. Please use the `for` loop function to get the minimum value
 of the list and print it in the console.

## 💡 Pista:

* Declare an Auxiliary Global Variable.

* Set it's value to a very big interger.

* Every time you loop, compare it's value to the item value. If the item value is smaller, update the auxiliary variable value to the item value.

* Outside of the loop, after the loop is finished, print the auxiliary value.

## Expected result:

```py
expected: 23
```
