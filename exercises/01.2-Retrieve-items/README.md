# `01.2` Retrieve items

The only way of accessing a particular element in an `list`(in python), is using an index.

An `index` is an integer number that represents the `position` you want to access in the list.

You need to `wrap` the index into `square brackets` like this:

```py
my_value = list[index]
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Print on the console the 1st element of the list

2. Print on the console the 4th element of the list

## 💡 Hint:

+ In Python, a list starts at position 0.

+ Do NOT hardcode your answer.
