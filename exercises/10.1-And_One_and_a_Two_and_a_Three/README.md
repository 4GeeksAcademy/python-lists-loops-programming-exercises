# `10.1` And one and two and three

**Dictionaries** (or `dict` in Python) are a way of storing elements just like you would in a Python list but instead of accessing elements using its index,
you assign a **fixed key** to it and access the element using the `key`. 

What you now deal with is a "key-value" pair, which is sometimes a more appropriate data structure
for many problem instead of a simple list.

## üìùInstructions:

1. Given a `contact` object, please loop all its properties and values and print them on the console.

2. You will have to loop its properties to be able to print them

```py
Example console output:
fullname : John Doe
phone : 123-123-2134
email : test@nowhere.com
```

## üí° Hint:

- contact.keys()  `['fullname', 'phone', 'email']`

- contact.values()  `['Jane Doe', '321-321-4321', 'test@test.com']`

- contact.items()  `[('fullname', 'Jane Doe'), ('phone', '321-321-4321'), `
                    `('email', 'test@test.com')]`
