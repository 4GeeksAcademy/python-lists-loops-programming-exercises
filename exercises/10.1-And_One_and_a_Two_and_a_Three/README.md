# `10.1` And one and two and three

Dictionaries (or dict in Python) are a way of storing elements just like you
would in a Python list. But, rather than accessing elements using its index,
you assign a fixed key to it and access the element using the key. What you now
deal with is a "key-value" pair, which is sometimes a more appropriate data structure
for many problems instead of a simple list.


# 📝Instruction
1. Given a contact object, please `loop all its properties and values` and print them on the console.
2. You will have to loop its properties to be able to print them

```py
Example console output:
fullname : John Doe
phone : 123-123-2134
email : test@nowhere.com
```

💡Hint:
- contact.keys()  `['fullname', 'phone', 'email']`

- contact.values()  `['Jane Doe', '321-321-4321', 'test@test.com']`

- contact.items()  `[('fullname', 'Jane Doe'), ('phone', '321-321-4321'), `
                    `('email', 'test@test.com')]`
