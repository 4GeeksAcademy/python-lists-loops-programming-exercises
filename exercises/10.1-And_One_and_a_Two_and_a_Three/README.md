# `10.1` And one and two and three

Dictionaries (or "dict" in Python) are a way of storing elements just like you would in a Python list, but instead of accessing elements using its index, you assign a fixed key to it and access the element using the key. What you now deal with is a `key: value` pair, which is sometimes a more appropriate data structure than a simple list.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Given a contact dictionary, please loop all its keys and values and print them on the console.

2. You will have to loop its properties to be able to print them.

## 💡 Hints:

- contact.keys()  `['fullname', 'phone', 'email']`

- contact.values()  `['Jane Doe', '321-321-4321', 'test@test.com']`

- contact.items()  `[('fullname', 'Jane Doe'), ('phone', '321-321-4321'), ('email', 'test@test.com')]`

## 💻 Example console output:

```py
fullname : John Doe
phone : 123-123-2134
email : test@nowhere.com
```
