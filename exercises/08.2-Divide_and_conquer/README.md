# `08.2` Divide and conquer:

## 📝Instructions:

1. Create a function called `merge_two_list` that expects an list of numbers (integers).

2. Loop through the list and separate the odd and the even numbers in different lists.

3. If the number is odd number push it to a placeholder list named `odd`.

4. If the number is even number push it to a placeholder list named even.

5. Then concatenate the `odd` list to the `even` list to combine them. Remember, the `odd` list comes first and you have to append the even `mergeTwoList`.

```py
Example:
mergeTwoList([1,2,33,10,20,4])

[[1,33,2], [10,20,4]]
```

## 💡Hint:

+ You can create empty(placeholder) variables to store data.
