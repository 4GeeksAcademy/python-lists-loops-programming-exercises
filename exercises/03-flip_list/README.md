# `03` Flip list

## 📝Instructions:

1. Create a variable `new_list` and set it's initial value to be an empty list ( `[]` ).

2. Using a loop, iterate the `arr` list in reverse.

3. Append each item from the `arr` list as you loop into the `new_list` variable.

4. With the `print()` function output in the console the result that you have store in the `new_list` variable.

## 💡 Hints:

- You should loop the entire list, and push all the items (as you go) into a new list.

- There are multiple ways of looping a list in reverse. If you are stuck, you can check out some ways of doing so in this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/529424/traverse-a-list-in-reverse-order-in-python

## Expected Result:

```py
initial list:  [45, 67, 87, 23, 5,  32, 60]
final list:    [60, 32, 5 , 23, 87, 67, 45]
```
