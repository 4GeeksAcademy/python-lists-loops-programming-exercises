# `03` Flip list

## 📝Instructions:

1. Create a variable `new_list`.

2. Using a loop, invert the `arr` list.

3. Append the result loop into the `new_list` variable.

4. With `print()` function output in the console the result that you have.

```py
Initial list:  [45, 67, 87, 23, 5,  32, 60]
Final list:    [60, 32, 5 , 23, 87, 67, 45]
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ You should loop the entire list, and push all the items (as you go) into a new list.
