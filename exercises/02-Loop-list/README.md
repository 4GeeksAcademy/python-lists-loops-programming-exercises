# `02` Loop list

## 📝Instructions:

1. Print all of the elements of the list called `my_list` in the console, instead of just the single value of the list.

## 💡 Hints:
  + You will have to loop through the whole array using a for loop.
  + If our goal is to print every item, which is a repetitive task, we can use a loop. Think, for `each_item` in `my_list`, what do we want? We can then use the namespace reference to each item by using `each_item` and perform any operations we want upon each iteration.
