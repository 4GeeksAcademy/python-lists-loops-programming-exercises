# `02` Loop list

## 📝Instructions:

1. Print all of the elements in the console, instead of just the single value of the list.

```py
You will have to loop through the whole array using a for loop.
```

 ### 💡 Hint

+ If our goal is to print every item, which is a repetitive task, we can use a loop. 

+ Think, for ***each_item*** in `my_list`, what do we want? We can then use the namespace reference to each item by using `each_item` and perform any operations we want upon each iteration.

## Expected result:


```py
232
32
1
4
55
4
3
32
3
24
5
5
5
34

```
