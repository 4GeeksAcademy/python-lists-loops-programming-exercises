Lists and loops are one of the most challenging topics to grasp when learning how to code. You will learn:

+ All the possible ways to loop in Python.

+ Looping lists, tuples, dictionaries and other data structures. 

The entire tutorial is 👆 interactive, ✅ auto-graded, and has 📹 video tutorials.

These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspellings, please contribute and report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-lists-loops-programming-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-lists-loops-programming-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```bash
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python
```

2. Download these particular exercises using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```bash
$ learnpack download python-lists-loops-programming-exercises
$ cd python-lists-loops-programming-exercises
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ $ pip3 install pytest==4.4.2 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small Python project containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry Python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
